# W07's TOP 10 Pages

I keep whatever site which is still relevant.

1. [Introduction of Process Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-process-synchronization/)<br>
It's an article that will give you a general outlook to Synchronization. It's pretty good because it have images to help explain things, and it is expressed in an easy to 
understand way

2. [Shared-Memory System](https://notesformsc.org/shared-memory-system/)<br>
An article further explaining on shared memory. I think this article is better than most article about shared memory, as it contain more information in general and it is
explained really well.


3. [Critical Section Problem](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/critical-section-problem#:~:text=The%20critical%20section%20is%20a,execute%20in%20their%20critical%20sections.)<br>
The article described about critical sections problem, and how it may be addressed. I like this one because it has diagram to help understand it, and 
explained in a succint manner. Also it won't even take 5 minutes to read.

4. [Data Replication & Consistency](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/webfm_send/1256)<br>
It's a lecture slide explaining Data Replication & Consistency. Honestly it is better than all the articles that I found, it have more informatian and better explanation 
than others. And each slide doesn't have too many text or example, but have enough information to digest and understand. A really good lecture slide imo.

5. [Semaphore](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/semaphore)<br>
An article by Baeldung explaining about Semaphore. It's a good article with good amount of information, not too short, not too long. It's reaaly good to give you an outlook
of Semaphore with just enough in depth technicality.


6. [The Dining Philosopher Problem](https://www.baeldung.com/java-dining-philoshophers)<br>
Somethat related the the previous article about semaphore, explaining the apparently famous Dining Philosopher Problem. It is well explained and have a code implementaton on 
java to further solidify your understanding. It's a pretty good read to understand concepts of circular wait and deadlock.


7. [Windows Kernel Synchronization](https://tylerrhodes.net/posts/windows-kernel-synchronization/)<br>
Explaining kernel Synchronization which implemented on windows. Although it's a somewhat wall of text kind of article, it is still well writtend and arguably understandble.
I choose the because it's interesting to understand the stuff we learn on windows (OS that I use on day to day basis) and it have just the right amount of text and information
for an article instead of long papers or half assed article that doesn't really explain anything.

8. [Deadlock Prevention & Avoidance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deadlock-prevention/)<br>
A very beneficial article that explain how to prevent and avoid deadlock. It's well explained, also complete with example on how to prevent and avoid deadlock. GFG makes
good articles I tell you.

9. [Deadlock Detection and Recovery](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/deadlock-detection-and-recovery-in-os)<br>
We learn how to prevent and avoid deadlock, but what happend if it already happended? How do you even know if it already happened? Well good news for you as this article 
will help and elaborate how detect and fix your deadlock. It's a well written article that also have pictures to help you understand. A good articel to be sure.


10. [The Sleeping Barber Problem](http://lasdpc.icmc.usp.br/~ssc640/grad/ec2015/sleeping_barber/solution.html)<br>
Another article about interesting problem. It's interesting and usefull because by understanding this, we should understand core concepts behind the real problems of 
running asynchronous operations on shared data. The article covers the problem well as well as the solution with the use of semaphore. A good read to be sure.
