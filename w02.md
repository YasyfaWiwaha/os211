# W02's TOP 10 Pages

I didn't change some sites from W00 and W01 , as some site is still quite relevant in W02.

1. [Linux Uprising](https://www.linuxuprising.com)<br>
It's an article site which themed around Linux. Apparently they focus it on Ubuntu, which is a shame but they still have plenty articles on other stuff too.

2. [Issues of Operating Systems Security](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228409741_Issues_of_Operating_Systems_Security)<br>
A short 5 pages paper explaining the concepts of security in operating systems. It explain the basics security feature that an OS provides. I believe this paper is 
worth the read!

3. [Operating System Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAhvVqw_dus)<br>
A 12 minutes long explainig various things on designing and customizing OS for better security. It explains mostly basic stuff, but with examples and tips for everyday user
to understand OS security and how to be less vunurable. For a 12 minutes long video the informations inside is a solid 5/7. Definetely recommned to watch.

4. [gpg4win](https://www.gpg4win.org)<br>
GNU Privacy Guard(GPG) for Windows! It's a free software too. With this you could encrypt and decrypt using gpg on windows. It also has an extension for outlook so you could
encrypt your email directly.

5. [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud923)<br>
While the link is available on vlsm, I think this need to be appriciated more. It's a course about OS, much better than the slides from the refrence book.

6. [Learn-C](https://www.learn-c.org)<br>
I did mention that you need to learn C, so here it is. They covered a lot of materials from hello world, to pointers and even bitmask. It's all free, no login no credit card scam, hehehe.
Also they have lots of similiar site on other language like Python, Go, JS, PHP, Ruby SQL, etc. Check it out if you are interested.

7. [DDOS Attack and it's evolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcDZS7iYNsA)<br>
A short video explaning DDOS attack from it's early days to it's modern counterparts. It's well explained and in a passionate way. So the video is really interesting imo.


8. [KeePass](https://keepass.info)<br>
An open source password manager. After learning various security vunurability, I belive having a strong password is a must have. But you can't have only one password for
every account you have and remembering each one for every account you have seems impossible. That's where a password manager come in handy. Keepass stores all of your
passwords in an encrypted database. So now you only need to remember the master password for your passwords database. You could read further on the web of what it could do 
and how it does it. Recommended to use for sure.

9. [EDX](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-programming)<br>
Somewhat similiar with Udacity. It's filled with tons of course created by top level university from all over the world. They have course on C, Linux basic, Linux Library, etc.
for this course, and a lot of other stuff outside this course or even cs fields. Definitely worh the check if you never hear of them.

10. [OS Sercurity Course Notese](https://www2.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/15_Security.html)<br>
Exactly what is said. It's notes for and OS course on security based on [Abraham Silberschatz, Greg Gagne, and Peter Baer Galvin, "Operating System Concepts, Seventh Edition "
, Chapter 15]. May not look great as standard web provides these days, but It contoains good solid information to study.
