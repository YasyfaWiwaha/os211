# W00 & W01's TOP 10 Pages

1. [Linux Uprising](https://www.linuxuprising.com)<br>
It's an article site which themed around Linux. Apparently they focus it on Ubuntu, which is a shame but they still have plenty articles on other stuff too.

2. [Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/)<br>
Basically stack overflow for ubuntu. Because ubuntu is based on Debian I still found bunch of usefull questions and answers that helped me on my assignment.

3. [VIM Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/)<br>
This website teach you about VIM by playing a game! Learning VIM doesn't get more interesting than that.I haven't finished it all but, it's pretty neat so far.
Although the control is kind of unusual to put it mildly, but I guess tha'ts just how VIM works.

4. [Git Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)<br>
Exactly what it says. It's officieal from GitHub Education so it's all good. Beautifully written and designed, so it's nice to look at. You could practically say goodbye to
googling everytime you messed around with git.

5. [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud923)<br>
While the link is available on vlsm, I think this need to be appriciated more. It's a course about OS, much better than the slides from the refrence book. The catch is you need
to learn a bit of C beforedoing the course, which is understandable and not that hard.

6. [Learn-C](https://www.learn-c.org)<br>
I did mention that you need to learn C, so here it is. They covered a lot of materials from hello world, to pointers and even bitmask. It's all free, no login no credit card scam, hehehe.
Also they have lots of similiar site on other language like Python, Go, JS, PHP, Ruby SQL, etc. Check it out if you are interested.

7. [nixCraft](https://www.cyberciti.biz)<br>
The site provides educational learning information on Linux and UNIX. They have articles, tutorials, and forum. Pretty usefull.

8. [Regular-Expressions.info](https://www.regular-expressions.info)<br>
Teach you the basic about regex. Although looks pretty old the content is really good imo. Also much better than a huge wall of text I often found everytime I want to learn
about the stuff from this course or TBA. People should stop making too many web dev tutorials and make OS tutorials and nothing will changed my mind about that.

9. [EDX](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-programming)<br>
Somewhat similiar with Udacity. It's filled with tons of course created by top level university from all over the world. They have course on C, Linux basic, Linux Library, etc.
for this course, and a lot of other stuff outside this course or even cs fields. Definitely worh the check if you never hear of them.

10. [Regexone](https://regexone.com)<br>
A site to help you learn regex with practice! Very usefull.
