# W02's TOP 10 Pages

I keep whatever site which is still relevant.

1. [File System general outlook](https://www.howtogeek.com/196051/htg-explains-what-is-a-file-system-and-why-are-there-so-many-of-them/)<br>
An article desicribing what is a file system in general. It's short, so it's a pretty good read to kinda have a mental image on file system.

2. [Files & File Systems: Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN8YgJnShPM)<br>
A 12 minutes long video explaining files and file system. It explain the material really well and with helpfull and cool animations. I recommend the youtube channel in general.

3. [Linux Virtual File System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4qWNNISdJk)<br>
This is a pretty long video explaining all about VFS, clocking at 42 minutes and 7 seconds. If you don't like long videos then this might not be you thing, but hey 
playbackrate is customizable fo a reason right? It's pretty solid on the info. he explain a lot of stuff so definetly worth the watch.

4. [The Virtual File System article](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/vfs.html)<br>
Give you overview of Virtual File System, and how to configure it, with various commancd and parameters explained. Really good, if you prefer reading.

5. [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud923)<br>
While the link is available on vlsm, I think this need to be appriciated more. It's a course about OS, much better than the slides from the refrence book.

6. [Linux - Tarballs, Archive and Compress Folders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcDZS7iYNsA)<br>
A short video explain what tarball in general are, and example on how to do it. It's only 12 minutes long, information on it is pretty solid. Though he talk pretty slow, So you could speed
it up and spend even less time on the video. GREAT!

7. [How Computers Compress Text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsTptu56GM8)<br>
A five minutes long video explaining basics and history of file compression. Very interesting.

8. [Compression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lto-ajuqW3w)<br>
A more detailed video on various kinds of compressions, such as image, and modern text compressing which is hinted on the 5 minutes video. The channel it came from is good
in general for computer science with lots of various interesting topics from many discipline. It is pretty famous so I'm pretty sure most of you know it, but hey you never know.

9. [EDX](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-programming)<br>
Somewhat similiar with Udacity. It's filled with tons of course created by top level university from all over the world. They have course on C, Linux basic, Linux Library, etc.
for this course, and a lot of other stuff outside this course or even cs fields. Definitely worh the check if you never hear of them.

10. OS File System Course Notese [Part 1](https://www2.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/11_FileSystemInterface.html) [Part 2](https://www2.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/12_FileSystemImplementation.html)<br>
Exactly what is said. It's notes for and OS course on security based on [Abraham Silberschatz, Greg Gagne, and Peter Baer Galvin, "Operating System Concepts, Seventh Edition "
, Chapter 15]. May not look great as standard web provides these days, but It contoains good solid information to study.
