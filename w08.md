# W08's TOP 10 Pages

I keep whatever site which is still relevant.
1. [CPU scheduling](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/cpu-scheduling#)<br>
Article giving description about CPU scheduling and types of scheduling. It is well written and well explained. Good read


2. [Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling/)<br>
Article describing difference between Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling. It is well discribed and have a table of comparison to make it easely understandable


3. [Difference between dispatcher and scheduler](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-dispatcher-and-scheduler/)<br> 
Article describing difference between dispatcher and scheduler. It is well discribed and have a table of comparison to make it easely understandable

4. [Thread Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/thread-scheduling/)<br>
Scheduling of threads involves two boundary scheduling,
Scheduling of user level threads (ULT) to kernel level threads (KLT) via leightweight process (LWP) by the application developer.
Scheduling of kernel level threads by the system scheduler to perform different unique os functions.

5. [CPU Burst](http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hamilton/courses/330/notes/scheduling/scheduling.html)<br> 
CPU burst is the amount of time the process uses the processor before it is no longer ready

6. [Completely Fair Scheduler](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/completely-fair-scheduler-cfs-and-brain-fuck-scheduler-bfs/)<br> 
It is based on Rotating Staircase Deadline Scheduler (RSDL).
It is default scheduling process since version 2.6.23.
Elegant handling of I/O and CPU bound process.

7. [Asymmetric Multiprocessing vs. Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP)](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-asymmetric-and-symmetric-multiprocessing)<br> 
Asymmetric multiprocessing is the use of two or more processors handled by one master processor. All CPUs are interconnected but are not self-scheduling. AMP is used to schedule specific task to CPU based on priority and importance of task.
Symmetric multiprocessing is the use of two or more self-scheduling processors sharing a common memory space. Each processor has access to I/O and memory devices. SMP applies multiple CPUs to a task to complete in parallel and faster fashion.

8. [Non-Uniform Memory Access](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/NUMA-non-uniform-memory-access)<br>
NUMA (non-uniform memory access) is a method of configuring a cluster of microprocessor in a multiprocessing system so that they can share memory locally, improving performance and the ability of the system to be expanded

9. [Load Balancing](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/load-balancing/)<br> 
Load balancing refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers, also known as a server farm or server pool.

10. [Multicore Processors](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2017/08/multicore-processing.html)<br>
A multicore processor is a single integrated circuit (a.k.a., chip multiprocessor or CMP) that contains multiple core processing units, more commonly known as cores. There are many different multicore processor architectures, which vary in terms of
