# W05's TOP 10 Pages

I keep whatever site which is still relevant.

1. [Virtual Memory in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>
I'm sure many of you is already familiar with GFG, but I find this particular aritcle to be very useful for this week materials. It explain virtual memory realy well, and written nicely.

2. [Yet Another Virtual Memory in Operating System](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm)<br>
Yes yes, it's abut the same stuff from my number one, but this also have bunch of others stuff that the first article didn't cover. Made by another familiar site, tutorials point.
The article by gfg also have some materials that tutorials point's didn't cover, so I include both, don't bully me Ok? Also it will be nice if you pick my list on your rank, teehee~.

3. [Dynamic Relocation](http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/360/tss/C20-1647-0_360-67_TSS_Tech.pdf#page=21)<br>
It's a quite long paper by IBM about Systems Refrence Library, though what I'm recommending you to read is only about the Dynamic Relocation part on page 21, my link is supoosed 
to get you directly there so I got you covered. But it's still a paper so it's longer than the articles on gfg and tp, though imo it's a pretty short read.

4. [Before Memory was Virtual](http://denninginstitute.com/pjd/PUBS/bvm.pdf)<br>
Another paper yaaay, everyone loves scientific paper right? of course! Anyway, it's history time! Well the title should tells you what's it's all about. So give it a read 
if you found it interesting. If you don't like reading paper, you could just read the first page and the conclusion , which is at the end of page 12.

5. [Memory Paging](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/)<br>
Another article from gfg, about paging. Basically it's how computer manage memory to minimizr physical memory alocation. Well read it if you wanna find out more I guess.

6. [Segmented, Paged and Virtual Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9yZNLeOj4s)<br>
This is a tribute to you who likes wathing video instead of reading. Granted it's basically a power point with sound explanation, but the materials is really good for a 7 minutes 
long video. Also better than nothing I guess.

7. [Windows 10 Optimize Performance Using Virtual Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztqg1DcxvVE)<br>
Hey, stuff that you learn sometime is usefull for day to day use! what do you know! Anyway it tells you how to customize you virtual memory on windows 10, to increase performance.
While the guy doesn't explain things all to well, I'm sure you understand where to look, for the unclear explanation he came up with. It's interesting, but only for windows 10.
Sorry if you're a mac / linux user. If you're on previous version of windows, then go update mate, we learned security few weeks ago.

8. [Number 7s further explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VDP5TCAK2c)<br>
I write this one bye one, so... yeah. This is an older videos, so it's for windows explain, but the explanation should still hold. Anyway interesting watch, for a 3 minutes video(minus the adds).

9. [Belady's Anomaly](https://prepinsta.com/operating-systems/beladys-anomaly/<br>
One of the things that could go wrong with memory paging. It's an articel, go read it if you wanna find out more.

10. [EDX](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-programming)<br>
Somewhat similiar with Udacity. It's filled with tons of course created by top level university from all over the world. They have course on C, Linux basic, Linux Library, etc.
for this course, and a lot of other stuff outside this course or even cs fields. Definitely worh the check if you never hear of them.
